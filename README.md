loop-it

This is a React 18 app that will work just like a guitar looper pedal. The pedal will give the user the option to record the ‘loops’ using an instrument plugged into the computer via a USB interface or import already created .mp3 files.
**This is an ongoing project**

 Below are instructions on how to set up and run the application locally.
